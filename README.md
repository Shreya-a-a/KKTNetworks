**Description**

This repository contains the code to build and test the KKT Net model.

KKT Net is a neural network approach designed to solve convex optimization problems by integrating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions—necessary and sufficient for optimality in convex problems—into its loss functions.

The gen_dataset.py file generates linear programming instances with normalized coefficients, which are used to train the KKT Net model. We use CVXPY to generate and solve these problems.

The kktnet_model.py file contains the code to build and train the KKT Net model using the dataset generated by gen_dataset.py.
